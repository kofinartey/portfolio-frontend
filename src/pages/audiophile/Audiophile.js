          <h2>Project Purpose and Goals</h2>
          <p>
            After taking a few courses in React and Redux, I needed to be put
            all the concepts I have learnt into practice. I picked up this
            project from{" "}
            <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="frontend mentor">
              Frontend Mentor
            </a>
            {". "}
            The focus of this project was to get a pretty good understanding of
            the React framework, state management in Redux and to be able to
            build something quite substantial with these tools.

          <h2>Problems and Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Biggest problem I encountered was figuring out how to increase count
            of an item that was already added to the cart when the "ADD TO CART"
            button is clicked without creating a new item in the cart with the
            same name. I know... easy peasy for you ðŸ˜„.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Getting the styling as close as possible to the designed website was
            quite challenging as it required a very in depth attention to
            detais.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>In the end I managed to get a decent understanding of</p>
          <ul>
            <li> the react framework's basics.</li>
            <li>state management in Redux.</li>
            <li>
              conditionally rendering page content based on URL parameters.
            </li>
          </ul>
