          <h2>Project Purpose and Goals</h2>
          <p>
            I learn more by building stuff based on concepts I have studied.
            Having gone through a few courses on React, I picked up this
            practice project from{" "}
            <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="frontend mentor">
              Frontend Mentor
            </a>{" "}
            with the aim of getting a good understanding of the React framework.
            And I managed to pull it off. And then came a few studies into the
            Fetch and making API calls. I did not so bad. However, in order to
            bring it all together, I needed to have a project of my own that
            sends some form of data from the frontend to a backend which I have
            control over. And this curiosity ended up in taking a entire Node Js
            course. The result of those weeks of study, turned out to be what I
            call Dirn Invoicing.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In short, the goal was to really understand how the frontend
            interacts with the backend.

            allow you to separate the building blocks of your project into

              React was perfect for this project since there were several
              components (buttons, input, modals,etc) with similar styling that
              needed to be repeated across the website.

              Node Js with Express seems to be default these days for any
              javascript developer looking to dabble a into the server side of
              web development. It requires no other language but the one you're
              already familiar with.

              MongoDB was a good choice for my database. It is very flexible and
              fairly easy to get started with.

          <h2>Problems and Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            As with many dev projects, I had to battle and overcome a few
            challenges. Key among these were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              {" "}
              figuring out how to provide an option to skip form validation when
              saving a draft.
            </li>
            <li>building a multilevel dropdown menu</li>
            <li>
              setting up a sever with various APIs for CRUD manipulations.
            </li>
            All these I did figure out eventually. Building this project was
            such a great learning experience.
