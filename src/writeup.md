# Dirn invoicing

## About

Dirn Invoicing is a simple invoicing tool to help freelancers and other service based entrepreneurs to keep track of payments

### Stack

React, Redux, Express, MongoDb, Material UI

## Project Purpose and Goals

I learn more by building stuff based on concepts I have studied. Having gone through a few courses on React, I picked up this practice project from Frontend Mentor with the aim of getting a good understanding of the React framework. And I managed to pull it off, I think üòè. And then came a few studies into the Fetch API. I did not so bad.
However, in order to bring it all together, I needed to have a project of my own that sends some form of data from the frontend to a backend which I have control over. And this curiosity ended up in taking a entire Node Js course.
The result of those weeks of study, turned out to be what I call Dirn Invoicing.
In short, the goal was to understand how the frontend interacts with the backend.

## Web stack explained

I love Vanilla Js, but when I got exposed to the fact that React allow you to separate the building blocks of your project into separate reuseable componets, I was blown awayü§Ø. React was perfect for this project since there were several components (buttons, input, modals,etc) with similar styling that needed to be repeated across the website.
Node Js with Express seems to be default these days for any javascript developer looking to dabble a into the server side of web development. It requires no other language but the one you're already familiar with.
MongoDB was a good choice for my database. It is very flexible and fairly easy to get started with.

## Problems and Lessons Learned

As with many dev projects, I had to battle and overcome a few challenges. Key among these were:

figuring out to apply validation to forms and providing the option to skip the validation when saving a draft.
building a multilevel dropdown menu
setting up a sever with various APIs for crud manipulations.

All these I did figure out eventually.
Building this project was such a great learning experience.

### stack

React, Redux, Material UI

## Project Purpose and Goals

After taking a few courses in React and Redux, I needed to be put all the concepts I have learnt into practice.

The focus of this project was to get a pretty good understanding of the React framework, state management in Redux and to be able to build something quite substantial with these tools.

## Problems and Lessons Learned

Biggest problem was figuring out how to increase count of an item that was already added to the cart when the "ADD TO CART" button is clicked without creating a new item in the cart with the same name. I know... easy peasy for you üòÑ.

Getting the styling as close as possible to the designed website was quite challenging as it required a very in depth attention to detais.

In the end I managed to get a decent understanding of

- the react framework's basics.
- state management in Redux.
- conditionally rendering page content based on URL parameters.
